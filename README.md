# Wofi Configuration

This repository contains a custom configuration for Wofi, the Wayland program launcher. This setup enhances the look and functionality of Wofi to fit your preferences.

## Installation

1. **Copy the Configuration**: Place the `wofi-config` file in your Wofi configuration directory, typically `~/.config/wofi/`.
2. **Apply the Configuration**: Restart Wofi or reload your Wayland session to apply the new settings.

## Customization

Edit the `wofi-config` file to tweak the appearance, behavior, and keybindings of Wofi to suit your needs.

### Dark Theme Support

This configuration works seamlessly with dark themes. You can easily adjust Wofi to match your dark mode setup by using tools like `nwg-look`. `nwg-look` simplifies the process of managing GTK themes, icons, and cursors under Wayland. Once installed, you can use it to set dark themes for Wofi, giving your launcher a cohesive look with the rest of your desktop environment.
